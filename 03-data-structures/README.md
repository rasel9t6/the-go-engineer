# Section 03: Data Structures

## Mission

This section teaches learners how Go stores and moves collections of data in memory, then shows how
that affects mutation and performance.

By the end of Section 03, you should be comfortable with:

- arrays as fixed-size value types
- slices as Go's main dynamic collection
- maps for keyed lookup
- pointers for mutation and nil-aware references
- combining those pieces in one small in-memory program

## Who Should Start Here

### Full Path

Start here after completing Section 02.

### Bridge Path

If loops, branching, and multiple return values already feel comfortable, begin at `DS.1`.

### Targeted Path

If you only want the live milestone, review these first:

- `DS.1` arrays
- `DS.2` slices
- `DS.3` maps
- `DS.4` pointers
- `DS.5` advanced slicing

## Section Map

| ID | Type | Surface | Why It Matters | Requires |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DS.1` | Lesson | [arrays](./1-array) | Introduces fixed-size collections and value-copy behavior. | entry |
| `DS.2` | Lesson | [slices](./2-slices) | Teaches Go's primary dynamic collection type and the length/capacity model. | `DS.1` |
| `DS.3` | Lesson | [maps](./3-maps) | Introduces keyed lookup and the comma-ok pattern for presence checks. | `DS.2` |
| `DS.4` | Lesson | [pointers](./4-pointers) | Shows how Go models mutation and shared access without pointer arithmetic. | `DS.1`, `DS.2` |
| `DS.5` | Lesson | [advanced slicing](./5-slices-2) | Explains shared backing arrays and the mutation traps that come with sub-slices. | `DS.2`, `DS.4` |
| `DS.6` | Exercise | [contact manager](./6-contact-manager) | Combines slices, maps, pointers, and simple struct management in one runnable milestone. | `DS.1`, `DS.2`, `DS.3`, `DS.4`, `DS.5` |

## Suggested Order

1. Work through `DS.1` to `DS.5` in order.
2. Complete `DS.6` without copying the finished solution line by line.

## Section Milestone

`DS.6` is the current live milestone for this section.

If you can complete it and explain:

- why slices and maps serve different jobs
- why pointers matter when updates must stick
- why shared backing arrays can surprise you when working with sub-slices

then you are ready to move into functions and errors in Section 04.
