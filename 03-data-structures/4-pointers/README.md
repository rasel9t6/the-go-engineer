# DS.4 Pointers

## Mission

Learn what a pointer is, how dereferencing works, and why pointers matter when an update must
change the original stored value rather than only a copy.

## Prerequisites

- `DS.1` arrays
- `DS.2` slices

## Mental Model

A pointer stores the address of a value.
You use it when you need to reach the original value and update it directly.

## Run Instructions

```bash
go run ./03-data-structures/4-pointers
```

## Code Walkthrough

### `score := 50`

This creates the original integer value.

### `scorePtr := &score`

`&score` means "the address of `score`."
This line creates a pointer that points at the original variable.

### The first `Printf` group

These lines print:

- the value in `score`
- the address of `score`
- the pointer value
- the value reached by dereferencing the pointer

`*scorePtr` means "go to the value stored at this address."

### `scoreCopy := score`

This copies the integer value.
It does not create another pointer.

### `scoreCopy = 95`

This changes only the copied value.
That is why the original `score` stays unchanged at that moment.

### `*scorePtr = 95`

This is the key pointer line in the lesson.

It means:

- go to the original value through the pointer
- change that original value directly

That is why `score` changes after this line.

### `phones := []string{...}`

This creates a slice so the lesson can connect pointers to stored collection elements.

### `bobPhone := &phones[1]`

This takes the address of the second phone number inside the slice.

That matters for the milestone because later the contact-directory exercise updates one stored phone
value through a pointer.

### `*bobPhone = "333-9999"`

This updates the slice element through the pointer.
The final print proves the stored slice data changed.

### `var optionalScore *int`

This declares a pointer whose zero value is `nil`.

### `if optionalScore == nil`

This is the safety check.
Dereferencing a nil pointer would panic, so the lesson shows the right habit first:

- check before dereferencing when nil is possible

## Common Questions

- Why not use pointers everywhere?
  Because many values do not need shared mutation. Use pointers when the original value must be
  reached directly.

- Why show a slice element pointer here?
  Because Section 03 ends with a milestone that updates stored slice data through a pointer.

## Production Relevance

Pointers matter whenever a Go program must mutate stored state intentionally and safely. They also
help learners stop confusing "copied value" with "original value."

## Next Step

Continue to `DS.5` slice sharing and capacity.
