# CP.5 URL Health Checker

## Mission

Build a concurrent URL checker that caps request fan-out, keeps request latency visible, and
reuses HTTP clients safely.

This exercise is the live capstone surface for Stage 07.

## Prerequisites

Complete these first:

- `CP.1` errgroup basics
- `CP.2` errgroup with context cancellation
- `CP.3` sync.Pool
- `CP.4` bounded pipeline exercise

## What You Will Build

Implement a health checker that:

1. issues concurrent HTTP HEAD requests with `errgroup.WithContext`
2. caps active checks with `SetLimit`
3. collects the result for each URL, including status and latency
4. sorts results by latency for a stable final report
5. reuses HTTP clients through a `sync.Pool`

## Files

- [main.go](./main.go): complete solution with teaching comments
- [_starter/main.go](./_starter/main.go): starter file with TODOs and requirements

## Run Instructions

Run the completed solution:

```bash
go run ./07-concurrency/02-concurrency-patterns/5-url-checker-exercise
```

Run the starter:

```bash
go run ./07-concurrency/02-concurrency-patterns/5-url-checker-exercise/_starter
```

## Success Criteria

Your finished solution should:

- bound concurrent HTTP checks instead of launching them without limits
- keep request construction context-aware
- sort output by latency instead of emitting random goroutine order
- reuse pooled clients safely without carrying stale state between checks

## Note

The current example uses live HTTP endpoints, so it expects network access when you run the full
solution.

## In Production

Health checking is a fundamental production operations pattern. Every load balancer, service mesh, and container orchestrator uses health checks to decide whether to route traffic to a given instance. The concurrent fan-out pattern this exercise teaches — bounded HTTP checks with result aggregation — is exactly how production monitoring systems like Prometheus blackbox exporter, uptime robots, and internal SLA monitors work. Sorting results by latency is not cosmetic: it reveals which endpoints are degrading before they fail completely, giving operations teams early warning. In production, health checkers run continuously on intervals and feed alerting systems. The `sync.Pool` for HTTP clients matters at scale because creating a new `http.Client` per check means establishing a new TCP connection (and TLS handshake) every time, adding hundreds of milliseconds of latency and wasting system resources. Reusing clients allows connection pooling via `http.Transport`, which keeps established connections warm.

## Thinking Questions

1. Why does this exercise use HTTP HEAD requests instead of GET requests for health checking, and what information do you lose by using HEAD?
2. If one of the checked URLs has a DNS resolution failure that takes 30 seconds to timeout, how does that affect the other concurrent checks?
3. How would you modify this tool to run as a continuous background service that checks URLs every 60 seconds and alerts when latency exceeds a threshold?
4. What is the difference between reusing an `http.Client` via `sync.Pool` and simply sharing a single global `http.Client` across all goroutines?
