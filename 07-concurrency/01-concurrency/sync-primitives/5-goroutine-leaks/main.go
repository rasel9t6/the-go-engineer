// Section 07: Concurrency
// Title: Goroutine leaks
// Level: Production
// ============================================================================
//
// WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
//   - Learn how goroutines get stranded and why lifetime ownership matters as much as spawning work.
//
// WHY THIS MATTERS:
//   - A goroutine leak is a task that never finishes because nothing closes its channel, cancels its context, or lets it return.
//
// RUN:
//   go run ./07-concurrency/01-concurrency/sync-primitives/5-goroutine-leaks
//
// KEY TAKEAWAY:
//   - [TODO: Summarize the core takeaway]

	fmt.Println("- Every launched goroutine needs a clear owner.")
	fmt.Println("- Contexts and channel closure define lifetime boundaries.")
	fmt.Println("- Leaks often hide behind blocked sends, blocked receives, or forgotten timers.")
	fmt.Println()
	fmt.Println("Leak prevention is mostly design discipline: every goroutine needs a stop condition that another part of the program actually controls.")
