# 03 Control Flow

## Mission

This section teaches learners how a Go program decides what to do next and how it repeats work
without turning into a wall of duplicated code.

By the end of this section, a learner should be able to:

- branch with `if`, `else if`, and `else`
- repeat work with `for`
- choose between multiple cases with `switch`
- stop or skip loop work with `break` and `continue`
- combine those ideas into one small runnable milestone

## Why This Section Exists Now

The learner already knows basic values and expressions.

That is enough to ask the next engineering questions:

- how does a program choose one path over another?
- how does it repeat the same operation without copy-pasting code?
- how does it stop early when the current path is no longer useful?

Those are control-flow questions.

## Zero-Magic Boundary

This section intentionally stays inside:

- values
- comparisons
- counters
- strings
- small list previews used only as loop targets

It does **not** formally teach:

- data-structure design
- helper-function design
- reusable error-return patterns
- package structure

You may see a tiny list preview inside a loop example.
That is a tool, not the topic.
Data structures are taught properly in the next section.

## Beta Stage Ownership

This section belongs to [1 Language Fundamentals](../../docs/stages/02-language-basics.md).

Inside the new repo architecture, it lives under `01-foundations`.

## Section Map

| ID | Type | Surface | Why It Matters | Requires |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CF.1` | Lesson | [if / else](./1-if-else) | Introduces branching and decision-making. | entry |
| `CF.2` | Lesson | [for basics](./2-for-basics) | Teaches Go's only loop keyword and the idea of repeated work. | `CF.1` |
| `CF.3` | Lesson | [break / continue](./3-break-continue) | Teaches early exit and selective skipping inside loops. | `CF.2` |
| `CF.4` | Lesson | [switch](./4-switch) | Teaches readable multi-branch decision logic after the learner already understands ordinary branching. | `CF.1`, `CF.2`, `CF.3` |
| `CF.5` | Exercise | [pricing checkout](./5-pricing-checkout) | Combines branching, looping, switching, and light list previews in one runnable milestone. | `CF.1`, `CF.2`, `CF.3`, `CF.4` |

## Suggested Learning Flow

1. Read each lesson `README.md` first.
2. Open `main.go` only after you understand the lesson mission.
3. Run each lesson and compare the output with the explanation.
4. Change one thing at a time using the `Try It` prompts.
5. Attempt the milestone starter before opening the finished solution.

## Section Milestone

`CF.5` is the live milestone for this section.

You are ready for the next section when you can explain:

- when `if` is enough and when `switch` reads better
- why Go only needs `for`
- when `break` stops the whole loop
- when `continue` skips only the current iteration
- why the small `range` example stays a preview instead of turning into a data-structures lesson

## Next Step

After `CF.5`, continue to `04-data-structures`.
That is where list and lookup structures stop being preview tools and become the real topic.
