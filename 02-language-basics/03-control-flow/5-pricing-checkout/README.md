# CF.5 Pricing Checkout

## Mission

Build one small checkout flow that turns the earlier control-flow lessons into a single readable, runnable program.

This is the section milestone.

## Why This Milestone Exists

The earlier lessons each taught one control-flow idea in isolation.

This milestone asks the learner to combine them:

- `if` for ordinary decisions
- `for` repeated work
- `switch` for readable multi-branch rules
- `continue` for skipping invalid items

## Production Relevance

In production Go code, combining control flow matters because:

- **Order processing**: Apply pricing rules, discounts, and validation
- **Batch jobs**: Process multiple items with different handling rules
- **Rule engines**: Execute different logic based on conditions

Real services build pricing engines, shopping carts, and checkout flows using exactly these patterns.

## Zero-Magic Boundary

This milestone uses a small list of item codes as a preview tool so the learner has something to
process in a loop.

That list is not the topic here.
Formal collection mechanics belong to the next section.

This milestone also avoids helper functions on purpose.
Section 05 is where reusable logic is taught properly.

## What You Will Build

Implement a checkout flow that:

1. loops over a small cart of item codes
2. uses `switch` to assign a base price
3. applies one simple discount rule with `if`
4. skips unknown items with `continue`
5. computes a running subtotal

```

## Solution Walkthrough

### `cart := []string{ ... }`

The cart is a small preview list of item codes.
The important control-flow idea is not the list itself.
The important idea is that the loop now has several inputs to process.

### `for _, item := range cart`

This repeats the same decision process for each cart entry.

### `switch item { ... }`

This is the pricing rule engine.
Each known code maps to a base price.

### `if price == 0 { ... continue }`

Unknown items are skipped safely.
The loop keeps running, but the subtotal is not polluted by invalid entries.

### `if item == "BOOK" { price = price * 0.90 }`

This is the extra branch rule.
It proves that `switch` does not replace `if`.
The two tools solve different decision shapes inside the same program.

### `subtotal += price`

This is the running-total pattern.
Each valid item contributes to the final answer.

## Try It

1. Add another known item code to the cart.
2. Change the book discount from `10%` to `15%`.
3. Put an unknown item in the middle of the cart and watch the loop skip it cleanly.
4. Add a second discount rule and explain why it belongs in `if` instead of `switch`.

## Common Failure Modes

- forgetting to skip unknown items
- applying the discount before a valid base price exists
- mixing too many future abstractions into a control-flow milestone

## Success Criteria

Your program is successful when it:

- processes the whole cart from top to bottom
- prices known items correctly
- applies the simple discount rule correctly
- skips unknown items safely
- prints a final subtotal

## Verification Surface

Use these proof surfaces together:

1. `go run ./02-language-basics/03-control-flow/5-pricing-checkout`
2. `go run ./02-language-basics/03-control-flow/5-pricing-checkout/_starter`

## Next Step

After this milestone, continue to `04-data-structures`.
That is where list and lookup behavior become the real topic instead of a preview tool.
