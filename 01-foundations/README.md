# 01 Foundations

## Mission

This folder is the true starting point for the new curriculum architecture.

Its job is not to rush learners into backend patterns or clever abstractions.
Its job is to build the first reliable mental model of:

- how Go programs run
- how decisions and repetition work
- how data is stored and moved
- how logic becomes reusable and failure-aware

## Internal Order

The foundations layer is intentionally ordered like this:

1. `01-getting-started`
2. `02-language-basics`
3. `03-control-flow`
4. `04-data-structures`
5. `05-functions-and-errors`

That order matters.
Each section should prepare the learner for the next one without hiding key ideas behind future
concepts.

## README-First Rule

Every learner-facing lesson in Foundations should work like this:

1. read the lesson `README.md`
2. open `main.go`
3. run the code
4. change the code yourself
5. attempt the starter or milestone when one exists

The README is the primary teaching surface.
The code is still mandatory, but it should stay clean enough that the learner can focus on what the
README already prepared them to see.

## Zero-Magic Rule

Foundations must stay honest.

That means:

- no helper-function design before functions are taught
- no heavy struct-based modeling before types and design
- no package architecture before engineering core
- no production concerns smuggled into beginner lessons

Small previews are allowed when they help the learner move forward, but they must be labeled
clearly and explained later in the proper section.

## Current Priority

The next real rebuild under this architecture is `04-data-structures`.

That section is where the learner stops treating lists and lookups as tiny preview tools and starts
working with:

- fixed-size values
- dynamic collections
- keyed lookup
- pointer-based mutation
- one small milestone that proves those ideas together

## Next Step

After `04-data-structures`, the next foundations section to make real is:

- `05-functions-and-errors`

Those three sections together are the main bridge from syntax exposure to engineering thinking.
