# CF.3 Switch

## Mission

Learn how to choose between several possible paths without writing long, hard-to-read branch
chains.

## Why This Lesson Exists Now

`if / else if / else` works well for a small number of branches.
When the number of cases grows, `switch` often reads more clearly.

## Run Instructions

```bash
go run ./01-foundations/03-control-flow/3-switch
```

## Code Walkthrough

### `day := "Monday"`

The first example starts with a simple text value.
The program wants different output depending on that value.

### `switch day { ... }`

This form compares one value against several cases.

It reads like:

- inspect `day`
- match the first fitting case
- run only that case

### `case "Saturday", "Sunday":`

One case can match more than one value.
That helps group related outcomes without duplicating code.

### `score := 82` and `switch { ... }`

This is the tagless form of `switch`.

Instead of comparing one named value, each case is a condition.
That makes it useful for ranges and guard-like logic.

## Common Mistakes

- reaching for `switch` when a single `if` would be clearer
- assuming Go falls through to the next case automatically
- forgetting that tagless `switch` cases are still checked from top to bottom

## Try It

1. Change `day` to `Sunday`.
2. Change `score` to `95`.
3. Reorder the score cases and see how that changes the result.

## Why This Matters In Real Software

`switch` is useful when code needs to react to:

- modes
- states
- commands
- categories

It often makes business rules easier to scan than long `if / else if` ladders.
