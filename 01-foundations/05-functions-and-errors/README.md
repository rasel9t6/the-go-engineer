# 05 Functions and Errors

## Mission

This section teaches learners how to turn inline logic into reusable functions and how to treat
failure as an explicit part of a function contract.

By the end of this section, a learner should be able to:

- write small functions with clear parameters and return values
- combine data-structure and control-flow knowledge inside reusable logic
- return `(value, error)` when a result can fail
- validate inputs before doing work
- sequence a few small functions into one honest milestone flow

## Why This Section Exists Now

The learner already knows:

- values and expressions
- branching and loops
- slices, maps, and pointer-aware mutation

That is enough to ask the next engineering questions:

- when should logic stop living directly inside `main()`?
- how should one piece of code give a result back to another?
- how should a program describe failure without hiding it?

Those are function-and-error questions.

## Zero-Magic Boundary

This section intentionally stays inside foundations-ready ideas:

- plain functions
- parameters and return values
- multiple return values
- errors as values
- validation and orchestration

It does **not** make later concepts part of the foundations-critical path:

- custom error types that depend on richer type modeling
- panic / recover as ordinary program flow
- functional options
- package architecture and cross-file system design

Those may remain in the repo as legacy or later-stage material, but they are not the primary
foundations route.

## Beta Stage Ownership

This section belongs to [1 Language Fundamentals](../../docs/stages/01-language-fundamentals.md).

Inside the new repo architecture, it is the fifth foundations section:

1. `01-getting-started`
2. `02-language-basics`
3. `03-control-flow`
4. `04-data-structures`
5. `05-functions-and-errors`

## Section Map

The canonical foundations order for this section is:

| ID | Type | Surface | Core Job |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FE.1` | Lesson | [functions basics](./1-functions-basics) | teach what a function boundary is |
| `FE.2` | Lesson | [parameters and returns](./2-parameters-and-returns) | teach input/output contracts |
| `FE.3` | Lesson | [multiple return values](./3-multiple-return-values) | introduce Go's multi-result style |
| `FE.4` | Lesson | [errors as values](./4-errors-as-values) | teach explicit failure handling |

The next lessons in this rebuild are:

- `FE.5` validation
- `FE.6` orchestration
- `FE.7` milestone project

## Current Rebuild Goal

This section is being rebuilt so that:

- learner-facing explanation stays in lesson `README.md` files
- `main.go` stays runnable and clean
- the milestone proves earned foundations concepts only
- old Section `04` material can be kept as legacy reference where helpful without confusing the new
  primary path

## Suggested Learning Flow

1. Read each lesson `README.md` first.
2. Open `main.go` only after the lesson mission and machine view are clear.
3. Run the code and compare the output with the walkthrough.
4. Change one thing at a time using the `Try It` prompts.
5. Move to the milestone only after the early lessons stop feeling mechanical.

## Next Step

The next implementation moves are:

- finish the foundations lesson flow through validation and orchestration
- rebuild the milestone around earned concepts only
- leave later-section ideas on the legacy path instead of mixing them into the foundations route
