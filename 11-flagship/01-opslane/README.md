# Opslane

## Mission

This surface is the active flagship implementation project for the stable v2.1 curriculum.

Opslane is where the curriculum stops being a collection of isolated lessons and becomes one
production-shaped backend that we can build, test, and harden in public.

## Stage Ownership

This project belongs to [11 Flagship](../README.md).

## Why This Project Matters

This project exists so the curriculum has one integrated system where earlier stage skills meet:

- backend request and data flow
- repository-style persistence boundaries
- package and handler structure
- runtime and deployment-oriented behavior
- longer feedback loops than a single exercise can provide

## Current Project Shape

| Area | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `cmd/server` | runnable flagship server entrypoint |
| `internal/config` | validated configuration loading and startup contract |
| `internal/db` | PostgreSQL setup, migrations, repository contracts, and transaction seams |
| `internal/models` | tenant-aware domain records for users, orders, and payments |
| `Dockerfile` | packages the application for containerized execution |
| `docker-compose.yml` | runs the application with PostgreSQL and the flagship API |
| `internal/` | holds the application boundaries that later modules will deepen |

## Module 2 Focus

Module 2 establishes:

- tenant-aware core models
- PostgreSQL startup and migration flow
- explicit repository contracts and transaction seams
- conservative pool settings and local persistence defaults

We now move beyond a bootable shell.
This slice gives Opslane a real persistence boundary so later modules can add auth, order flow, and
async processing on top of a coherent data model instead of placeholders.

## Run the Project

For the local shell:

```bash
docker-compose up -d db
go run ./11-flagship/01-opslane/cmd/server
```

Optional environment overrides:

```bash
$env:OPSLANE_ENV="development"
$env:OPSLANE_HTTP_ADDR=":8080"
$env:OPSLANE_LOG_LEVEL="debug"
$env:OPSLANE_DB_DSN="postgres://opslane:secretpassword@localhost:5432/opslane?sslmode=disable"
go run ./11-flagship/01-opslane/cmd/server
```

Make sure Docker is available, then run from this directory:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Current HTTP Surface

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

The health endpoint now checks the live PostgreSQL connection before reporting the service as ready.

## Next Step

After Module 2 is in place, the next build slice is authentication and tenant isolation so Opslane
can turn this persistence foundation into an actual multi-tenant request flow.
