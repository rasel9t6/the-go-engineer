# Opslane

## Mission

This surface is the active flagship implementation project for the stable v2.1 curriculum.

Opslane is where the curriculum stops being a collection of isolated lessons and becomes one
production-shaped backend that we can build, test, and harden in public.

## Stage Ownership

This project belongs to [11 Flagship](../README.md).

## Why This Project Matters

This project exists so the curriculum has one integrated system where earlier stage skills meet:

- backend request and data flow
- repository-style persistence boundaries
- package and handler structure
- runtime and deployment-oriented behavior
- longer feedback loops than a single exercise can provide

## Current Project Shape

| Area | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `cmd/server` | runnable flagship server entrypoint |
| `internal/auth` | password hashing, signed tokens, auth context, and tenant identity middleware |
| `internal/config` | validated configuration loading and startup contract |
| `internal/db` | PostgreSQL setup, migrations, repository contracts, and transaction seams |
| `internal/models` | tenant-aware domain records for users, orders, and payments |
| `Dockerfile` | packages the application for containerized execution |
| `docker-compose.yml` | runs the application with PostgreSQL and the flagship API |
| `internal/` | holds the application boundaries that later modules will deepen |

## Current Progress

Opslane now uses an explicit module system instead of one static flagship label.

The current repository state is:

- `OPSL.1` complete: foundation and configuration
- `OPSL.2` complete: database and models
- `OPSL.3` complete: authentication and tenant isolation
- `OPSL.4` complete: HTTP API layer
- `OPSL.5` next: order processing

Use the progress surface instead of guessing:

```bash
go run ./11-flagship/01-opslane/scripts/progress.go
```

Then use the learner map:

- [Opslane module map](./MODULES.md)
- [OPSL.1 module spec](./modules/01-foundation/README.md)
- [OPSL.2 module spec](./modules/02-database/README.md)
- [OPSL.3 module spec](./modules/03-auth/README.md)
- [OPSL.4 module spec](./modules/04-http-api/README.md)

## Module 4 Snapshot

`OPSL.4` establishes:

- public JSON API routes for tenant setup, user setup, and login
- protected order and payment routes that use authenticated tenant identity
- consistent JSON error responses
- CORS and simple in-process rate limiting middleware

This slice turns the auth and persistence foundation into a runnable HTTP contract.
Protected handlers do not accept tenant IDs from request bodies. They read tenant and user identity
from verified auth context, then pass that trusted identity into repository calls.

## Run the Project

For the local shell:

```bash
docker-compose up -d db
go run ./11-flagship/01-opslane/cmd/server
```

Optional environment overrides:

```bash
$env:OPSLANE_ENV="development"
$env:OPSLANE_HTTP_ADDR=":8080"
$env:OPSLANE_LOG_LEVEL="debug"
$env:OPSLANE_DB_DSN="postgres://opslane:secretpassword@localhost:5432/opslane?sslmode=disable"
$env:OPSLANE_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET="development-only-opslane-secret-change-me"
go run ./11-flagship/01-opslane/cmd/server
```

Make sure Docker is available, then run from this directory:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Local Data Volume

The Compose stack uses the versioned volume `opslane_pg16_data` for PostgreSQL 16 data.

That name is intentional. It avoids reusing older local `pgdata` volumes that may contain a
previous PostgreSQL major version or older bootstrap credentials. If you previously ran an older
Opslane compose stack, the new stack starts from its own database volume instead of silently
reusing incompatible data.

## Current HTTP Surface

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/me
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/me
```

The health endpoint now checks the live PostgreSQL connection before reporting the service as ready.
The `/me` and `/api/v1/me` endpoints are intentionally protected. They return `401 Unauthorized`
without a bearer token and return the tenant-scoped identity when a valid Opslane token is supplied.

### Setup and Login

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/tenants \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Acme Inc","slug":"acme"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tenant_id":1,"email":"admin@example.com","display_name":"Admin","password":"CorrectHorse7Battery","role":"admin"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"tenant_id":1,"email":"admin@example.com","password":"CorrectHorse7Battery"}'
```

### Protected API

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"total_cents":2500,"currency":"USD","idempotency_key":"checkout-123"}'

curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"order_id":1,"provider_reference":"pay_123","amount_cents":2500}'

curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/orders/1/payments \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Next Step

After `OPSL.4`, continue to [OPSL.5](./modules/05-order-processing/README.md).
That module moves Opslane from CRUD surfaces into explicit business state transitions and
failure-aware workflows.
