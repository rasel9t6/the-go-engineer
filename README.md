Welcome to **The Go Engineer** — the definitive open-source Go curriculum. Every section teaches through **practical examples, real-world projects, and hands-on exercises** — not just syntax. You'll build servers, CLI tools, concurrent pipelines, REST APIs, and production-grade applications while learning the engineering depth behind every concept.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Go: https://go.dev/dl/  (see 01-core-foundations/getting-started)
# 2. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/rasel9t6/the-go-engineer.git
cd the-go-engineer

# 3. Download dependencies
go mod download

# 4. Verify Go is working
go version

# 5. Run your first program
go run ./01-core-foundations/getting-started/2-hello-world
```

## The Elite 15-Chapter Learning Path

This repository follows a strict **Language → Runtime → IO → Quality → Architecture** progression. Every chapter cleanly decouples concepts by their primary domain.

- `01-core-foundations`: Development environment, syntax basics, constants (GS, LB).
- `02-control-flow`: Execution branches, for loops (CF).
- `03-data-structures`: Arrays, slices, maps, pointers (DS).
- `04-functions-and-errors`: First-class closures, defer, error design (FE).
- `05-types-and-interfaces`: Structs, methods, interfaces, generics (TI).
- `06-composition`: Struct embedding (CO).
- `07-strings-and-text`: UTF-8, regex, templates (ST).
- `08-modules-and-packages`: Go modules, versioning (MP).
- `09-io-and-cli`: Filesystem (FS), Encoding (EN), CLI Tools (CL).
- `10-web-and-database`: Databases (DB), Masterclass (WM), HTTP Client (HC).
- `11-concurrency`: Goroutines (GC), Context (CT), Time (TM).
- `12-concurrency-patterns`: errgroup, sync.Pool (CP).
- `13-quality-and-performance`: Testing (TE), Mocking (HM), Profiling (PR).
- `14-application-architecture`: Package Design (PD), Logging (SL), gRPC (GR), Shutdown (GS), Capstone (EC).
- `15-code-generation`: //go:generate (CG).

## Guided Learning Patterns

This curriculum is not just a linear list. It follows specific architectural decisions:

| Pattern | Behavior | Examples |
| ------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Linear** | Strictly A → B → C | Control Flow, Composition, gRPC |
| **Fork/Rejoin** | Independent paths that merge | DS.4 (Pointers) needed by DS.5 only |
| **Deep Exercise** | Synthesis of all previous prereqs | DS.6, FE.9, TI.6, GC.7 |
| **Parallel Track** | Non-blocking concurrent subjects | Race conditions run alongside channels |

## Projects & Exercises

## How to Use This Repository

The best way to learn is by **reading the inline comments** and **running the code**.

```bash
# Run any lesson
go run ./CHAPTER/LESSON

# Examples:
go run ./01-core-foundations/getting-started/2-hello-world
go run ./01-core-foundations/language-basics/1-variables
go run ./11-concurrency/goroutines/3-channels
go run ./10-web-and-database/web-masterclass/1-routing

# Chapter 13 — Quality and Testing
go run ./13-quality-and-performance/profiling/1-cpu-profile
```

### Self-Challenge Mode

Most exercises include a `_starter/` directory with TODO stubs:

```bash
# Try the exercise yourself first:
go run ./02-control-flow/4-pricing-calculator/_starter

# Then compare with the solution:
go run ./02-control-flow/4-pricing-calculator
```

For the grand finale, boot the entire Enterprise Backend cluster (Database + Migrations + API) using Docker:

```bash
# Run the massive Chapter 14 Capstone project
cd 14-application-architecture/enterprise-capstone
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Running the Tests

To verify your environment is set up correctly, run the full test suite over the entire domain structure:

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...
```

## Windows Users — CGO Note

Chapter 10 (`databases`) and Chapter 14 (`enterprise-capstone`) use `go-sqlite3`, which requires CGO and a C compiler. On Windows without WSL:

1. Install [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/)
2. Set environment: `$env:CGO_ENABLED = "1"` (PowerShell)

We recommend [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) for the best experience.
