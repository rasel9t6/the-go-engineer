Learn Go by building, testing, and operating real software.

The Go Engineer is a repo-first Go software engineering learning system built around a progressive **5-phase, 12-section architecture** (v2.1).

It takes a learner from machine fundamentals and first execution all the way to a production-shaped Go backend capstone.

For the full curriculum source of truth, read [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Current Status

The v2 beta migration is complete on `main`.

- `release/v1`: stable v1 line for current learners
- `main`: completed v2 beta implementation line
- `release/v2`: reserved for v2 RC and stabilization once feature freeze begins

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rasel9t6/the-go-engineer.git
cd the-go-engineer
go mod download
go version
go run ./00-how-computers-work/1-what-is-a-program
```

## What You Will Build

You will work through:

- beginner-friendly exercises and starter projects
- parsers, filesystem tools, and CLI utilities
- HTTP services and database-backed applications
- concurrency pipelines, worker pools, and timeout-aware clients
- profiling, testing, and benchmark-driven improvements
- structured logging, graceful shutdown, configuration, observability, and deployment workflows
- **GoScale**: a production-shaped SaaS backend capstone

## Validate the Repo

```bash
go run ./scripts/validate_curriculum.go
go test ./...
```

## Windows Note

Some database and capstone paths use `go-sqlite3`, which requires CGO and a C compiler.
If you are on Windows, WSL2 is the smoothest setup for those paths.
