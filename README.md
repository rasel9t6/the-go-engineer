Welcome to **The Go Engineer** — the definitive open-source Go curriculum. Every section teaches through **practical examples, real-world projects, and hands-on exercises** — not just syntax. You'll build servers, CLI tools, concurrent pipelines, REST APIs, and production-grade applications while learning the engineering depth behind every concept.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install Go: https://go.dev/dl/  (see 01-core-foundations/getting-started)
# 2. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/rasel9t6/the-go-engineer.git
cd the-go-engineer

# 3. Download dependencies
go mod download

# 4. Verify Go is working
go version

# 5. Run your first program
go run ./01-core-foundations/getting-started/2-hello-world
```

## Release Channels

The repository now uses a long-lived branch model for the v1 to v2 transition:

- `main` is the active v2 development branch and the default target for new sections, lessons, and features.
- `release/v1` is the stable v1 support branch for existing users who want the current curriculum line.
- `release/v2` will be created later from `main` when v2 enters beta and feature freeze.
- `v1.0.0` stays as an immutable release tag. It is not the long-term maintenance branch name.

If you want the stable v1 curriculum, check out `release/v1` or a stable `v1.x.y` tag. If you want the newest v2 work as it lands section by section, stay on `main`.

## Who is This For?

- **Complete beginners** — Never programmed before? Start at Section 01. Every line is explained.
- **Developers from other languages** — Know Python/JS/Java? Skim the basics, deep-dive into Go-specific patterns.
- **Go developers leveling up** — Already write Go? Jump to Chapters 09+ for concurrency, testing, and production patterns.

## The 6-Phase Learning Path

The curriculum is structured into 6 logical phases, taking you from **Zero to Senior Engineer** across 15 high-impact chapters.

### 🟦 Phase 1: Foundations (01–04)
*Language Basics, Control Flow, Data Structures, Functions & Errors.*
The bedrock of Go. Master pointers, slices, and Go's unique error handling.

### 🟩 Phase 2: Intermediate (05–08)
*Types & Interfaces, Composition, Strings & Text, Modules & Packages.*
Learn "The Go Way" of abstraction. No inheritance—just composition and interfaces.

### 🟧 Phase 3: IO & CLI (09)
*Filesystem, Encoding (JSON/XML/Base64), CLI Tools.*
Building tools that interact with the real world.

### 🟥 Phase 4: Systems (10–12)
*Web Masterclass, Databases, Concurrency, Concurrency Patterns.*
Building high-performance servers that scale through goroutines and channels.

### 🟪 Phase 5: Architecture (13–14)
*Testing, Mocking, Profiling, Package Design, Logging, gRPC, Shutdown.*
Production engineering: observability, type-safe RPCs, and performance tuning.

### ⬛ Phase 6: Professional (15)
*Code Generation (Mockery, SQLC).*
Automating the boring parts of development to scale your productivity.

## Guided Learning Patterns

This curriculum is not just a linear list. It follows specific architectural decisions:

| Pattern | Behavior | Examples |
| ------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Linear** | Strictly A → B → C | Control Flow, Composition, gRPC |
| **Fork/Rejoin** | Independent paths that merge | DS.4 (Pointers) needed by DS.5 only |
| **Deep Exercise** | Synthesis of all previous prereqs | DS.6, FE.9, TI.6, GC.7 |
| **Parallel Track** | Non-blocking concurrent subjects | Race conditions run alongside channels |

## How to Use This Repository

The best way to learn is by **reading the inline comments** and **running the code**.

```bash
# Run any lesson
go run ./CHAPTER/LESSON

# Examples:
go run ./01-core-foundations/getting-started/2-hello-world
go run ./01-core-foundations/language-basics/1-variables
go run ./11-concurrency/goroutines/3-channels
go run ./10-web-and-database/web-masterclass/1-routing

# Chapter 13 — Quality and Testing
go run ./13-quality-and-performance/profiling/1-cpu-profile
```

### Self-Challenge Mode

Most exercises include a `_starter/` directory with TODO stubs:

```bash
# Try the exercise yourself first:
go run ./02-control-flow/4-pricing-calculator/_starter

# Then compare with the solution:
go run ./02-control-flow/4-pricing-calculator
```

For the grand finale, boot the entire Enterprise Backend cluster (Database + Migrations + API) using Docker:

```bash
# Run the massive Chapter 14 Capstone project
cd 14-application-architecture/enterprise-capstone
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Running the Tests

To verify your environment is set up correctly, run the full test suite over the entire domain structure:

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with race detection
go test -race ./...
```

## Windows Users — CGO Note

Chapter 10 (`databases`) and Chapter 14 (`enterprise-capstone`) use `go-sqlite3`, which requires CGO and a C compiler. On Windows without WSL:

1. Install [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/)
2. Set environment: `$env:CGO_ENABLED = "1"` (PowerShell)

We recommend [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) for the best experience.
