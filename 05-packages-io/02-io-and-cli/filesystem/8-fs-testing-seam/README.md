# FS.8 FS Testing Seam

## Mission

Learn how to decouple your code from the physical disk using the `io/fs` package, enabling you to write lightning-fast tests that run entirely in memory using `fstest.MapFS`.

## Prerequisites

- `FS.7` log-search-project

## Mental Model

Think of `fs.FS` as a **Universal Adapter for Storage**.

Before, your code was "Hard-Wired" to the house's electricity (the physical disk). If you wanted to test it, you had to be at the house. By using `fs.FS`, you've changed your code to use a "Battery Adapter." Now, in production, you can still plug it into the wall (`os.DirFS`), but in testing, you can use a portable battery (`fstest.MapFS`) and run your code anywhere, even in a vacuum with no disk I/O at all.

    B -- "Testing" --> E["fstest.MapFS (In-Memory)"]
```

## Machine View

The `io/fs` package defines the `FS` interface, which has a single method: `Open(name string) (File, error)`. Because this interface is so simple, almost anything can implement it.
- `os.DirFS(".")` creates an implementation that maps calls to your local disk.
- `fstest.MapFS` creates an implementation that maps calls to a `map[string]*fstest.MapFile` in memory.
When your code calls `fs.WalkDir` or `fsys.Open`, it doesn't know (or care) where the bytes are coming from. This is the ultimate form of "Inversion of Control" for filesystem operations.

## Run Instructions

```bash
go run ./05-packages-io/02-io-and-cli/filesystem/8-fs-testing-seam
```

## Code Walkthrough

### `SearchLogs(fsys fs.FS, ...)`
Notice the signature of this function. It doesn't take a directory path string; it takes an `fs.FS` interface. This is the "Seam" that allows us to swap the filesystem implementation.

### `os.DirFS(".")`
Used in the `main` function to provide a real view of the current directory to our logic.

### `fstest.MapFS` (in tests)
Inside the `main_test.go` (if provided) or in your own tests, you would define a `MapFS` with a few dummy files. This allows you to verify your search logic without actually creating files on your hard drive, making your tests faster, safer, and more reliable.

### `fs.WalkDir`
A generic version of `filepath.WalkDir` that works on any `fs.FS`. It allows you to traverse any virtual or physical folder tree using the same consistent API.

## Try It

1. Write a small test (or a separate main function) that uses `fstest.MapFS` to search for a string in a virtual log file.
2. Use `embed.FS` (from the previous lesson) as the input to `SearchLogs`.
3. Implement a custom `fs.FS` that always returns an error when `Open` is called, and see how your `SearchLogs` function handles it.

## In Production
The `fs.FS` interface is **read-only**. It is perfect for reading configurations, templates, and logs. However, if you need to **write** files, you will still need to use the `os` package or define your own "Writable Filesystem" interface. For 90% of reading tasks, however, `fs.FS` is the modern Go standard.

## Thinking Questions
1. Why is code that accepts interfaces easier to test than code that uses global state or hardcoded paths?
2. What are the advantages of using `fstest.MapFS` over `os.MkdirTemp` for unit tests?
3. How does the "Accept interfaces, return structs" rule apply to the design of `SearchLogs`?
