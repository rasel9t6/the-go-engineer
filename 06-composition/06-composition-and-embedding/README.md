# Composition and Embedding

This directory holds the live Section 06 teaching surfaces.

## Learning Surfaces

| ID | Surface | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CO.1` | [composition](./1-composition) | Named-field composition, has-a modeling, explicit reuse |
| `CO.2` | [embedding](./2-embedding) | Anonymous fields, promoted methods, field shadowing |
| `CO.3` | [bank account project](./3-bank-account) | Milestone exercise combining both lessons in one small domain |

## Why This Section Matters

Go favors explicit composition over inheritance-heavy class hierarchies.
That means learners need to be able to answer three questions clearly:

- when should a type own another type as a named field?
- when does embedding make access cleaner without hiding too much?
- when is shadowing behavior helpful, and when does it make the model harder to read?

Use `CO.1` and `CO.2` to build those answers before taking on `CO.3`.

## Next Step

Return to the [Section 06 overview](../README.md) for the full learner path, or jump straight to
[CO.3](./3-bank-account) when you are ready for the milestone.
