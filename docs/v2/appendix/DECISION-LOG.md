# V2 Decision Log

Use this file to record planning decisions that affect v2 structure, sequencing, migration, or
release strategy.

## How To Use This Log

Each decision should capture:

- date
- decision summary
- why the decision was made
- alternatives considered
- follow-up actions

## Working Decisions

### 2026-04-07: v2 planning is ready to open prototype work

- Status: Working decision
- Why it matters: the team needs a clear gate between endless planning and prototype execution
- Alternatives:
  - delay prototype work until every open planning question is fully resolved
  - begin prototype work once the planning stack is coherent enough to guide it
- Follow-up: start the prototype phase under `#84` and use the prototype to resolve non-blocking
  design questions

### 2026-04-07: keep the current top-level section numbering and directory layout through prototype and early migration waves

- Status: Working decision
- Why it matters: early renumbering would add churn before the training system itself is proven
- Alternatives:
  - preserve the current numbering and layout first
  - redesign the top-level layout before prototype validation
- Follow-up: only revisit numbering after the prototype and first migration waves prove a clear
  learner benefit

### 2026-04-07: keep `curriculum.json` active while designing richer v2 metadata in parallel

- Status: Working decision
- Why it matters: the repo needs schema evolution without breaking the current stable line
- Alternatives:
  - replace `curriculum.json` immediately
  - keep it active and prototype a richer v2 schema in parallel
- Follow-up: prove the richer metadata model in the prototype before deciding final canonical
  storage

### 2026-04-07: keep assessment and progress repo-native through the prototype and alpha stages

- Status: Working decision
- Why it matters: platform work would dilute focus before the curriculum system is proven
- Alternatives:
  - start platform features during early v2 planning
  - keep assessment repo-native until later rollout stages
- Follow-up: revisit only after alpha if repo-native checkpoints and projects prove insufficient

### 2026-04-07: v2 should use one curriculum with three canonical learning paths

- Status: Working decision
- Why it matters: path design affects docs, metadata, checkpoints, and migration behavior
- Alternatives:
  - maintain one curriculum with route logic
  - build separate content trees for different learner types
- Follow-up: prove the path model in the prototype through one section README, one checkpoint, and
  one milestone item

### 2026-04-07: the Bridge Path requires milestone mini-projects rather than every mini-project

- Status: Working decision
- Why it matters: the Bridge Path should preserve proof without recreating the Full Path workload
- Alternatives:
  - require every mini-project
  - require only milestone mini-projects plus path-critical project work
- Follow-up: verify during the prototype that this still preserves honest readiness signals

### 2026-04-07: every v2 section should have a top-level README as a required navigation surface

- Status: Working decision
- Why it matters: the current repo lacks a consistent section-entry contract for learners
- Alternatives:
  - rely mainly on the root README and directory order
  - require a top-level section README with path-aware entry guidance
- Follow-up: test the section README contract in the prototype slice before applying it widely

### 2026-04-07: keep the learning-path guide at the repo root and keep `docs/curriculum/README.md` as the public curriculum map during the prototype stage

- Status: Working decision
- Why it matters: learners need stable discovery surfaces while v2 planning is still being proven
- Alternatives:
  - move those docs immediately into a new layout
  - keep the existing public discovery locations during the prototype stage
- Follow-up: reconsider doc placement after the first learner-facing migration wave if the
  navigation system proves a better structure

### 2026-04-07: local sub-track README files are only required when a section has multiple learner-facing internal tracks or milestone surfaces

- Status: Working decision
- Why it matters: the docs system needs consistency without forcing README files where they add no
  navigation value
- Alternatives:
  - require sub-track README files everywhere
  - require them only where internal track navigation is real
- Follow-up: test this threshold in the prototype section outline

### 2026-04-07: the validator should prioritize structural and metadata truth before broader teaching checks

- Status: Working decision
- Why it matters: the repo needs trustworthy automation without pretending every curriculum quality
  concern can be parsed mechanically
- Alternatives:
  - try to automate most review logic immediately
  - keep the validator focused on paths, commands, ids, links, and required assets first
- Follow-up: expand validator scope gradually after the prototype proves which additional checks are
  worth automating

### 2026-04-07: navigation integrity should be split between validator truth and reviewer judgment

- Status: Working decision
- Why it matters: link existence and learner usefulness are different quality problems
- Alternatives:
  - try to automate all navigation quality
  - let the validator check truth while reviewers check clarity and usefulness
- Follow-up: keep refining this split during prototype validation

### 2026-04-07: rubric-verified items should use a standard README shape

- Status: Working decision
- Why it matters: rubric-based items need visible and consistent completion rules
- Alternatives:
  - let rubric items vary freely
  - require a standard README shape for rubric-based verification
- Follow-up: prove the README shape in the prototype checkpoint and project surfaces

### 2026-04-07: keep the current validator as a single growing tool through the prototype stage

- Status: Working decision
- Why it matters: splitting tooling early would add maintenance overhead before the right boundaries
  are proven
- Alternatives:
  - split validation into multiple tools now
  - keep one tool through the prototype stage and split later only if justified
- Follow-up: revisit after the first alpha wave if validator scope becomes unwieldy
