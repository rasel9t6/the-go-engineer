# V2 Lesson Spec

## Purpose

This document defines the canonical contract for a v2 lesson.
It should align curriculum design, repo structure, contributor behavior, and future validator rules.

## Definition

A lesson is the smallest canonical teaching unit in the curriculum.
It is larger than a note and smaller than a project.

A good lesson:

- teaches one primary concept
- uses a small number of supporting concepts
- is runnable or directly verifiable
- points to prerequisites and the next step
- includes production relevance

## Lesson Types

v2 should support four lesson shapes:

### 1. Concept Lesson

- introduces a core language or design idea
- usually centers one runnable example

### 2. Pattern Lesson

- teaches a reusable engineering pattern
- usually compares good and bad approaches

### 3. Integration Lesson

- combines several prior concepts in a controlled example
- often sits immediately before an exercise or checkpoint

### 4. Reference Lesson

- used sparingly for tooling, commands, or environment setup
- should still include executable verification where possible

## Canonical Lesson Contract

Every v2 lesson should define:

- `id`
- `title`
- `slug`
- `section`
- `level`
- `lesson_type`
- `estimated_time`
- `prerequisites`
- `primary_objective`
- `supporting_objectives`
- `production_relevance`
- `run_command` or `test_command`
- `next_step`

## Repo Layout

The default lesson layout should be:

```text
NN-section-name/
  [optional-subgraph/]N-lesson-name/
    main.go
    README.md        # optional for complex lessons
    main_test.go     # optional when testable behavior adds value
    testdata/        # optional when fixtures matter
```

For larger architectural lessons, a small package layout is allowed if the teaching goal requires
it. That exception should be used intentionally, not casually.

## Required Teaching Anatomy

Every lesson should include the following layers.

### 1. Framing

State:

- what the learner is about to learn
- why it matters
- where it sits in the wider curriculum

### 2. Core Example

Show a runnable or inspectable implementation that expresses the main idea clearly.

### 3. Explanation

Explain behavior, tradeoffs, gotchas, and the reason the example is shaped this way.

### 4. Production Relevance

Answer:

- where this shows up in real Go work
- what common failure mode it prevents
- what habit the learner should keep

### 5. Exit Ramp

Tell the learner what to do next:

- next lesson
- drill
- exercise
- section checkpoint

## Code Header Contract

Every lesson entry file should keep the existing project strengths and include:

- section and lesson title
- level
- "what you'll learn"
- "engineering depth"
- run command

The current code standards are a good baseline. v2 should standardize them rather than replacing
them with a totally new style.

## When A Lesson Needs A README

A lesson should include `README.md` when:

- runtime setup is non-trivial
- the lesson has multiple files or commands
- diagrams, tables, or structured comparisons help understanding
- the learner needs troubleshooting help beyond inline comments

Otherwise, the code file should remain the primary teaching surface.

## When A Lesson Needs Tests

A lesson should include tests when:

- the behavior being taught is naturally testable
- the lesson teaches testing or validation itself
- the example would benefit from showing how correctness is asserted

Do not add tests only to satisfy a checkbox if they do not improve the lesson.

## Size Guidelines

A lesson likely needs to be split when:

- it introduces more than one major new concept
- the explanation becomes dependent on several unrelated digressions
- the runnable example is large enough that the core idea is hard to see

A lesson likely needs to be merged when:

- it is too small to justify navigation weight
- it cannot stand on its own objective
- it exists only because of naming or folder convenience

## Authoring Rules

Maintain these rules when writing a lesson:

- explain why, not only what
- do not assume hidden prerequisites
- prefer one strong example over many shallow ones
- show mistakes and tradeoffs when they teach something real
- do not overbuild architecture in early sections

## Definition Of Done

A lesson is ready for v2 when:

- the objective is clear
- the run or test command works
- the metadata matches the lesson reality
- the next step is obvious
- the production relevance is explicit
- the lesson is small enough to be teachable and large enough to matter
