# 09 Architecture

## Purpose

`09 Architecture` teaches how systems are shaped at the package and service-boundary level.

## Who This Is For

- learners who already build, test, and profile non-trivial systems
- developers who want stronger structure and boundary reasoning

## Mental Model

Architecture is not diagram theater.
It is the discipline of choosing boundaries that keep code understandable, testable, and able to
change safely.

## What You Should Learn Here

- package boundary design
- service contracts and interface seams
- architectural trade-offs in real systems
- larger-system reasoning through focused reference surfaces

## Stage Support Docs

- [Architecture support index](./architecture/README.md)
- [Stage map](./architecture/stage-map.md)
- [Milestone guidance](./architecture/milestone-guidance.md)

## Finish This Stage When

- you can explain why a system is split the way it is
- you can spot weak package boundaries and suggest better ones
- you can discuss service seams with evidence instead of slogans
- you can use the package-design proof path to justify architectural choices

## Next Stage

Move to [10 Production](./10-production.md).
