# PR.2 Live pprof Endpoint

## Mission

Expose live profiling endpoints on an internal-only server so you can inspect CPU, heap, mutex,
and goroutine behavior while a service is under load.

This surface is the profiling-track output for Stage 08.

## Prerequisites

Complete these first:

- `PR.1` CPU profile

## Files

- [main.go](./main.go): runnable pprof demo server with a separate public API mux and admin port

## Run Instructions

```bash
go run ./08-quality-test/01-quality-and-performance/profiling/3-http-pprof
```

Then inspect the running service with commands such as:

```bash
go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=5
go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap
```

## Success Criteria

You should be able to:

- explain why pprof handlers are registered through the blank import
- describe the two-port pattern for keeping pprof off the public API
- use CPU and heap endpoints to inspect a live service safely

## In Production

Continuous profiling is how mature engineering organizations debug performance degradation in real-world environments. Synthetic load tests rarely capture the exact behavior of production traffic, so the ability to pull a CPU or heap profile from a live, struggling service without stopping it is invaluable. However, exposing `net/http/pprof` directly on a public-facing API port is a critical security vulnerability: it leaks internal execution state, memory footprints, and potentially sensitive variables to the internet. The two-port pattern shown in this exercise — binding the main application to one port (e.g., 8080) and the diagnostic/admin handlers to a separate, internal-only port (e.g., 6060) — is the industry standard mitigation. This ensures profiling is accessible only to operators or internal metric scrapers, never to external users.

## Thinking Questions

1. Why does importing `net/http/pprof` with the blank identifier (`_`) automatically register handlers, and why is this considered a risky pattern in library code?
2. If you notice a memory leak in production, which pprof profile (heap, goroutine, allocs) would you check first, and what specifically would you look for?
3. What is the performance overhead of leaving the HTTP pprof endpoints active in production continuously?
4. How would you secure a pprof endpoint if you could not use a separate port and had to serve it on the main public router?

## Next Step

After `PR.2`, continue to the [Stage 08 overview](../README.md) or move to
[Stage 09: Application Architecture](../../../../09-architecture).
