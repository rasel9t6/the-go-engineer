## [2026-04-06] - Long-Lived v1/v2 Branch Workflow

### Changed

- Adopted `main` as the active v2 development branch and `release/v1` as the stable v1 maintenance line.
- Replaced the branch-per-release guidance in the contributor and release docs with a long-lived support branch model.
- Documented squash-merge for pull requests and `git cherry-pick -x` for fixes that must ship in both supported lines.
- Updated the PR template so contributors target `main` by default and call out v1 backports explicitly.

## [2026-04-06] - Curriculum Dependency Integration

### Added

- **Curriculum Dependency Graph:** Automated granular mapping of 15 sections across 28 sub-graphs using `curriculum.json`.
- **Premium Console Footers:** Integrated "Next Up" context-aware navigation footers into all 115 `main.go` files.
- **Visual Breadcrumbs:** Added previous/next/exercise navigation links to all section READMEs.
- **Root Metadata:** Updated root `README.md` and `ROADMAP.md` with the new ID-based learning path (GS, LB, CF, etc.).
- **Validation Script:** Created `scripts/validate_curriculum.go` to ensure filesystem integrity for all future additions.

### Fixed

- **ID Collision:** Resolved ID collisions for "Graceful Shutdown" vs "Getting Started" by implementing section-specific context namespaces.
- **Bulk Refactor Cleanup:** Fixed widespread Go syntax errors and markdown lint issues introduced during the integration phase.
- **[BUG] Chapter 1 Lesson 1:** Added missing instructions to `1-installation` (GS.1) boilerplate (#4).

## [2026-04-05] - The v1.0 Curriculum Migration

### Changed

- **Curriculum Architecture:** Completely refactored the legacy 28 flat-folder structure into an elite, chronologically ordered 15-chapter book format.
- **Cross-Domain Separation:** Decoupled concepts by their primary domain, cleanly separating runtime operations (`11-concurrency/time-and-scheduling`) and external operations (`09-io-and-cli/encoding`).
- **HTTP Domain Split:** Amputated the HTTP Clients/Mocking directory exactly down the middle, separating true HTTP networking (`10-web-and-database/http-client`) from test abstraction limits (`13-quality-and-performance/http-client-testing`).
- **Internal Imports:** Ran a mass-migration script converting all legacy `internal/` pointers uniformly.
- **Docs Update:** Rewrote README tables, ROADMAP tracking lists, and CONTRIBUTING guides natively reflecting the elite `v1` path routing.

### Removed

- DELETED the legacy compatibility `symlinks` from the repository root entirely!

### Fixed

- **Bug:** `23-structured-logging/3-custom-handler` - `slog.DiscardHandler` instantiation type error fixed by removing struct brackets.
- **Bug:** `12-concurrency-patterns/3-sync-pool` - duplicate `BenchmarkWithPool` declaration causing compilation failure removed from `main.go`.
- **Bug:** `25-profiling/1-cpu-profile` and `10-filesystem/8-fs-testing-seam` - redundant newline formatting in `fmt.Println` fixed to standard `fmt.Print`.
- **Bug:** `26-grpc` - missing generated Protocol Buffer Go files added using `protoc` and properly imported into `gen` package.
- **Bug:** Global repository string literals - fixed widespread compilation errors caused by improper line breaks across several past modules.

### Changed
