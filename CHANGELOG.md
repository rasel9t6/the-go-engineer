### Fixed

- **Bug:** `23-structured-logging/3-custom-handler` — `slog.DiscardHandler` instantiation type error fixed by removing struct brackets.

- **Bug:** `25-profiling/1-cpu-profile` and `10-filesystem/8-fs-testing-seam` — redundant newline formatting in `fmt.Println` fixed to standard `fmt.Print`.
- **Bug:** `26-grpc` — missing generated Protocol Buffer Go files added using `protoc` and properly imported into `gen` package.
- **Bug:** Global repository string literals — fixed widespread compilation errors caused by improper line breaks across several past modules.
