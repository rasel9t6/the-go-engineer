# TI.15 Method Values

## Mission

Learn how to treat methods as first-class values—assigning methods to variables and passing them as function arguments.

## Why This Lesson Exists Now

In Go, methods can be extracted from their receiver and used as values. This is useful for callbacks, event handlers, and deferred function calls.

## Prerequisites

- `TI.2` methods

## Mental Model

Think of a button on a remote. You can press the button (call the method), or you can program the button to trigger something else (use the method as a value). Method values let you treat the button itself as a thing you can store and use later.

## Visual Model

```go
type Counter struct{ Value int }

func (c *Counter) Increment() { c.Value++ }

// Method as value - the receiver is bound
counter := &Counter{}
incFunc := counter.Increment // This is a func()
// Calling it later
incFunc()
incFunc()
fmt.Println(counter.Value) // 2
```

## Machine View

When you capture a method value, Go binds the receiver to that function value. Calling the stored function later is like calling the original method with the same receiver already attached.

## Run Instructions

```bash
go run ./04-types-design/15-method-values
```

## Code Walkthrough

### Extracting a method

`obj.Method` returns a function value with the receiver bound.

### Using method values

Pass method values to functions that expect func().

### Method values vs closures

Method values capture the receiver; closures capture variables.

## Try It

1. Store a method in a map of event handlers.
2. Pass a method value to a defer statement.
3. Compare method values with closures capturing the same receiver.

## Production Relevance

Method values are used in HTTP handlers, event systems, and anywhere you need to pass a method as a callback.

## Next Step

Continue to `TI.16` complex generic constraints if you want to finish the optional stretch path.
