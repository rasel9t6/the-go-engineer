# TI.12 Type Assertions

## Mission

Learn how to extract concrete types from interface values using type assertions and the comma-ok pattern.

## Why This Lesson Exists Now

You have learned that interfaces can hold any type that implements their methods. Sometimes you need to extract the underlying concrete type to access type-specific fields or methods. Type assertions let you do this safely.

## Prerequisites

- `TI.3` interfaces

## Mental Model

Think of a vending machine that returns items in generic boxes. You know it might contain a soda, a snack, or water, but you need to open the box (type assert) to find out which one you got and access its specific properties.

## Visual Model

```go
// Basic type assertion
var i interface{} = "hello"
s := i.(string)  // s is now "hello"

// Safe type assertion with comma-ok
s, ok := i.(string)  // ok is true if assertion succeeded
```

## Machine View

A type assertion checks if the underlying concrete type matches the expected type. If it does, the value is returned. If not, the panic can be avoided using the comma-ok form.

## Run Instructions

```bash
go run ./04-types-design/12-type-assertions
```

## Code Walkthrough

### Basic assertion

`value.(Type)` panics if the type doesn't match.

### Comma-ok pattern

`value, ok := value.(Type)` returns ok=false instead of panicking.

### Type switch

Use `value.(type)` inside a switch to handle multiple types.

## Try It

1. Create an interface{} holding different types and assert each.
2. Use comma-ok to safely handle failed assertions.
3. Combine type assertions with type switches.

## Production Relevance

Type assertions are used when reading from generic containers, handling dynamic data, and working with interface types from external sources.
