# TI.7 Receiver Sets

## Mission

Learn the difference between value and pointer receivers and understand how method sets determine interface satisfaction.

## Why This Lesson Exists Now

After learning methods in TI.2, you need to understand how receiver choice affects what methods your type actually provides. This matters when your type needs to satisfy an interface.

## Prerequisites

- `TI.2` methods
- `TI.3` interfaces

## Mental Model

Think of a type's method set like a menu. A Counter value has only the Get() menu item. A *Counter pointer has the full menu: Get(), Inc(), Reset(). The pointer version inherits the value receiver methods but adds its own.

## Visual Model

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Counter (value type)                │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Get() int     ✓ (value receiver)   │
│ Inc()        ✗ (pointer receiver)  │
│ Reset()      ✗ (pointer receiver)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ *Counter (pointer type)            │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Get() int     ✓ (inherited)        │
│ Inc()        ✓ (pointer receiver) │
│ Reset()      ✓ (pointer receiver) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Machine View

At runtime, Go checks the method set when assigning to an interface. A value type only satisfies interfaces if all required methods are in its method set—those from value receivers plus any pointer receivers if the address is taken.

## Run Instructions

```bash
go run ./04-types-design/7-receiver-sets
```

## Code Walkthrough

### Counter struct

A simple struct with an integer field.

### Value receiver methods

Get() uses a value receiver—it works on both Counter and *Counter.

### Pointer receiver methods

Inc() and Reset() use pointer receivers—they only work on *Counter.

### Interface satisfaction

The Reader interface requires Get(). Counter value satisfies it because Get() has a value receiver. *Counter also satisfies it because pointer types inherit value receiver methods.

## Try It

1. Try assigning a Counter value to a variable that needs Inc()—it fails because the value doesn't have that method.
2. Pass &Counter to the same variable—it works because the pointer has Inc().
3. Add a new method with a pointer receiver and see if the interface still accepts the value type.

## Production Relevance

Method sets affect API design. If you export a type that only has pointer receiver methods, callers must pass pointers. If you mix receiver types, document which interface they satisfy.

## Next Step

Continue to `TI.8` (custom errors) in the stretch path, or move to `TI.9` generics, then tackle the payroll milestone at `TI.10`.
